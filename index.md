This dashboard aims to showcase the power of Earth Observations to inform on societal global challenges. It is a joint cooperation between [ESA](https://www.esa.int/) and the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_en). The activity started in 2020, triggered by Covid-19 crisis and
served as testbed for Open Innovation, with participation of European Industry and citizens.

In October 2022 the activity was rebranded to "Rapid Action for Citizens with Earth Observation", as it continues the rapid development of EO-informed indicators with societal relevance (such as air quality, agricultural production or manufacturing volumes), and it provides more open tools for interaction (such as Jupyter Notebooks and free tutorials on Earth Observation).
