## Explore RACE

RACE (Rapid Action for Citizens with Earth Observation) is a collaborative Earth Observation innovation initiative by [ESA](https://www.esa.int/) and the [European Commission - DG DEFIS](https://commission.europa.eu/about/departments-and-executive-agencies/defence-industry-and-space_en) with contributions from a wide network of European partners. Its purpose is showcase accessible and meaningful indicators on topics that relate to everyday life, such as pollution and environment, the economy, and society, derived from Earth Observations and other open data sources. RACE indicators are developed by companies, research institutes, academia, and Copernicus services, showcasing the breadth of European EO capabilities and their relevance to everyday life. 

By allowing users to explore examples of what EO can reveal about their surroundings and places of interest and presenting these insights through interactive tools and stories, RACE aims to encourage curiosity and helps citizens appreciate the role and potential of EO in modern society.

RACE resources and data are openly available, offeirng companies, researchers, and developers opportunities to build upon the data and explore new applications that reflect Europe’s evolving EO innovation landscape.
